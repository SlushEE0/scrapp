Scrapp - Smart Waste Disposal Helper

_Congressional App Challenge 2025 Submission_

## What is Scrapp?

Ever wondered if that weird plastic container can be recycled? Or where to throw
away old batteries? Scrapp is here to help! Just take a photo of anything you
want to dispose of, and our app will tell you exactly how to get rid of it
properly.

## Why We Built This

We noticed that people (including ourselves) often don't know the right way to
throw things away. This leads to recyclables ending up in landfills, hazardous
items in regular trash, and a lot of confusion at the recycling bin.

We wanted to make it simple: take a picture, get an answer. No more guessing, no
more complicated recycling guides just quick, clear help when you need it.

## What We've Built So Far

- Camera that works: Point, shoot, and capture photos with your phone
- Mobile-friendly: Works great on phones and computers
- Clean design: Simple, easy-to-use interface

## What's Coming Next

- AI-Powered Recognition: Analyze captured images to identify waste items
- Disposal Recommendations: Provide specific disposal instructions based
  on item type and location
- Location-Based Services: Find nearby recycling centers and disposal
  facilities
- Impact Tracking: Monitor environmental impact and disposal habits
- Gamification: Achievement system to encourage proper waste disposal
- Progressive Web App: Offline functionality and app-like experience

## Congressional App Challenge

We're high school students participating in the Congressional App
Challenge 2025. The challenge asks students to create apps that help their
communities, and we chose to tackle the confusion around proper waste disposal.

The Problem: People don't know how to dispose of things properly, which
hurts the environment.

Our Solution: Scrapp makes it simple - just take a photo and get clear
disposal instructions.
